INFO: pip is looking at multiple versions of langchain-huggingface to determine which version is compatible with other requirements. This could take a while.

The conflict is caused by:
    The user requested langchain-core==0.2.24
    langchain 0.2.11 depends on langchain-core<0.3.0 and >=0.2.23
    langchain-huggingface 0.3.1 depends on langchain-core<1.0.0 and >=0.3.70

Additionally, some packages in these conflicts have no matching distributions available for your environment:
    langchain-core

To fix this you could try to:
1. loosen the range of package versions you've specified
2. remove package versions to allow pip to attempt to solve the dependency conflict
